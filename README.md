# reference-kbc

This repository was created as part of a PoC to implement a client for
[reference-kbs](https://github.com/virtee/reference-kbs) that also works with
`no_std` crates. This is to support the client also in firmware such as
[COCONUT-SVSM](https://github.com/coconut-svsm/svsm).

As development continues and we decided to support more servers such as
[KBS](https://github.com/confidential-containers/kbs/) and
[keybroker](https://github.com/tylerfanelli/keybroker),
**this repository is archived and we move development to
https://github.com/stefano-garzarella/RAClients**
